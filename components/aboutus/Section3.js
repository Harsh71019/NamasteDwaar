              One of the most gifted architects India has had, the late Mr.
              Pradeep Sachdeva is the mastermind behind some of Indiaâ€™s most
              inspiring architectural works including the Garden of Five Senses,
              the famous Dilli Haat Buildings, and now Namaste Dwaar. Mr.
              Sachdeva has created something truly remarkable and unique in
              Uttar Pradesh. With a key focus on sustainable architecture, the
              infrastructure of Namaste Dwaar was designed so that it could
              coexist with the ecosystem, while simultaneously complimenting the
              aesthetic of the surrounding regions. Having taken into
              consideration the distinctive villages of U.P, this property
              serves to showcase the traditional art forms that are at risk of
              being lost in this age of modernization and urban development.
