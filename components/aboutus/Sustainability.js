            At Namaste Dwaar, we are grateful for the environment we exist in
            and for what it provides us with. Therefore, we are fully committed
            to protecting and giving back to the ecosystem which surrounds us.
            We have planted an abundance of flowering plants and trees to
            promote green cover and to encourage the preservation of
            biodiversity; we have also developed our own organic farms so that
            we can grow produce while ensuring that the soil is fertile and
            secures stable yields for many years.
          </p>
          <p className='sustain-about__para'>
            We have replaced regular garbage bins with specific waste disposal
            baskets (green for eco-waste, red for plastic, and blue for
            compost). We limit plastic usage in our property and the upcycling
            of products also plays a major role in reducing our carbon footprint
            on the environment. Moreover, conserving water and electricity is
            extremely important for our facility and therefore we have
            implemented the STP (Sewage Treatment Plant) for this purpose.
          </p>

            As for our infrastructure, the main building incorporates green
            features including insulated external walls and highly insulated
            windows, that help improve thermal comfort and reduce energy
            consumption.
